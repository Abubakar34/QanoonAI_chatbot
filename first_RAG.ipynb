       " 'answer': \"<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out the punishment for murder based on the given legal sections. Let me start by going through each section to understand how they relate to murder and its punishment.\\n\\nFirst, I see sections about abettors and their liability. Section 114 talks about an abettor being present when the offense is committed, making them liable as if they committed it. Section 115 deals with abetting offenses punishable by death or life imprisonment. If the offense isn't committed, the abettor can get up to seven years in prison. If someone is hurt, it can go up to fourteen years. So, if someone abets murder but the murder isn't committed, they can still be punished, but not as severely as if the murder happened.\\n\\nLooking at sections 364 and 365, these are about kidnapping or abducting someone under fourteen with the intent to murder or cause harm. The punishment here can be death, life imprisonment, or up to fourteen years in jail. So, if someone kidnaps a child with the intent to murder, the punishment is severe.\\n\\nSections 394 to 397 are about robbery and causing hurt. If someone causes hurt during a robbery, they can get life imprisonment or up to ten years. If it's dacoity (which is like a more serious robbery with a group), the punishment is similar but can include death if someone is murdered during the dacoity.\\n\\nSections 449 to 452 deal with house-trespass with the intent to commit serious offenses. If someone trespasses to commit a murder, they can get life imprisonment or up to ten years. If the intended offense is punishable by life imprisonment, it's up to ten years, and for other imprisonable offenses, up to two years, or seven years if it's theft.\\n\\nPutting this together, murder itself isn't directly addressed in these sections, but the abetment and related offenses are. So, if someone abets a murder that is actually committed, they would be liable under section 114 as if they committed it. That means the punishment for murder would typically be death or life imprisonment, as those are standard punishments for murder in many legal systems.\\n\\nI should also consider if any of these sections explicitly mention murder. Section 364 mentions murder as a possible intent for kidnapping, leading to severe punishment, but not the murder itself. So, the punishment for the act of murder would fall under the general murder laws, which are likely covered elsewhere, but in the context of abetment and related offenses, the abettor would face similar severe punishments.\\n\\nTherefore, the punishment for murder, especially when considering abetment and related serious offenses, would be death or life imprisonment, possibly with fines and other terms as specified in the sections.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe punishment for murder, based on the provided legal sections, is as follows:\\n\\n1. **Abetment of Murder**: If someone abets a murder that is actually committed, they are liable under section 114 as if they committed the murder. This typically results in the same punishment as the murderer.\\n\\n2. **Punishment for Murder**: The act of murder itself generally carries severe penalties, typically death or life imprisonment, as standard in many legal systems.\\n\\n3. **Related Offenses**: If murder is committed during other serious offenses like dacoity (section 396), all involved parties can face death, life imprisonment, or up to ten years in prison.\\n\\nIn summary, the punishment for murder, especially when involving abetment or during other serious crimes, is severe, often resulting in death or life imprisonment.\"}"

      "I should also consider if any of these sections explicitly mention murder. Section 364 mentions murder as a possible intent for kidnapping, leading to severe punishment, but not the murder itself. So, the punishment for the act of murder would fall under the general murder laws, which are likely covered elsewhere, but in the context of abetment and related offenses, the abettor would face similar severe punishments.\n",

      "The punishment for murder, based on the provided legal sections, is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Abetment of Murder**: If someone abets a murder that is actually committed, they are liable under section 114 as if they committed the murder. This typically results in the same punishment as the murderer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Punishment for Murder**: The act of murder itself generally carries severe penalties, typically death or life imprisonment, as standard in many legal systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Related Offenses**: If murder is committed during other serious offenses like dacoity (section 396), all involved parties can face death, life imprisonment, or up to ten years in prison.\n",
